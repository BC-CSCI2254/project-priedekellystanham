Presenters!: you should plan for ~8 minutes, with just one person as the designated presenter.
Your presentation should include
1. a statement of the idea,
2. a quick demo,
3. a quick summary of the issues faced and the tools that you used and finally
4. a minute or two for questions. A practice talk wouldn't hurt.

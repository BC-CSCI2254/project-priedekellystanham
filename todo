---------------------------------

1. Created to use with CameraMouse, a desktop app developed for the program
EagleEyes through the campus school.
- CameraMouse allows tracking of a students eyes ... problem was usability
- Would only be able to work with online games

- GOAL: goal of our web app is to make testing the students easier by displaying the questions
at opposite edges of the screen
- Shake of the head when the app is tracking their eye movement will not effect
their answer choice

Overview (Primary App Components):
  1) MongoDB: store user test data and display questions, answers (mlab)
  2) Jade (vs EJS) viewing engine with Mongo -> pull data and store
  3) Server side rendering
  4) Made w/ Node and Express

2. Enter username: (USED MongoDB - form pulls through SERVER SIDE JADE RENDERING)
Create Test and select answer options
Run (PULLS JSON FILE sent from SERVER to view created tests)
View Stats

3. PROBLEMS
  1) MongoDB - JSON var transfer to JS file // manipulation // schema
     Solution: in-line script
  2) Sending correct variable to another file
     Solution: local storage
  3) Form interpretation of checkboxes for correct answers
     Solution: brute force id's for each box

Future Goals:
  1) Display and run pre-made test options
  2) Show how (and save) the student answers

- MongoDB: learning curve || creating a proper schema || sending JSON file of
DB collection
- JADE: choosing jade as VIEWING ENGINE for server side rendering || between EJS and Jade
|| problems with connecting scripts and stylesheets || MAIN PROBLEM WITH SENDING JSON DB (solved with inline script ...)
|| AUTO propogating questions and answers
- Sending correct variable to multiple pages : just use local storage ... (reloading script files)
- Interpreting check boxes for correct ans
